# SessionCheck

The SessionCheck plugin will check and update the current session in
the background.

With the plugin you avoid a session timeout and the loss of the 
progress while working on a larger SCORM package.

## Installation
Just clone or download the latest version from the master branch to 
your Moodle installation and walk through the site update process or
run the upgrade.php from command line:

    $ php admin/cli/upgrade.php --non-interactive
    


## Usage

After the installation no further action is needed. 

The plugin will run in the background and check if the current session
is still active or timed out.
